= Semantic Authority and Invariant Hierarchy
:status: normative
:audience: spec authors, implementers

== Overview

Semantic meaning in Cerro Torre is defined hierarchically.

This hierarchy prevents accidental transfer of authority from the specification to tooling.

== Authority Layers

=== Layer A — Written Specification (Authoritative)

Defines:

* Manifest meaning
* Validity rules
* Canonical form
* Error taxonomy
* Versioning and compatibility

All semantics MUST be expressible in plain language here.

=== Layer B — Golden Corpora (Enforcement)

Golden corpora:

* Make the spec executable
* Prevent semantic drift
* Serve as regression contracts

They do not define new meaning.

=== Layer C — Proof Artifacts (Reinforcing Only)

Includes:

* SPARK proof obligations
* ATS shadow verification
* Formal checks

These MAY detect errors but MUST NOT define semantics.

Failure of proofs does not invalidate the spec.

=== Layer D — Type-Level Constraints (Local Hygiene)

Types MAY:

* Prevent misuse internally
* Encode local invariants

Types MUST NOT:

* Replace validation
* Encode semantics not present in the spec

== Normative Rule

Every invariant enforced by tooling MUST be describable in the written specification.

If it cannot be written down, it is not a valid invariant.
