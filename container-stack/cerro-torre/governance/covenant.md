# The Palimpsest Covenant

**Version**: 1.0  
**Effective**: Upon adoption

## Preamble

A palimpsest is a manuscript page that has been written on, scraped off, and written on again — yet traces of earlier writing remain visible beneath. Software is similar: every contribution builds upon what came before, and the history of that evolution matters.

The Palimpsest Covenant is not a license. It does not impose legal obligations beyond those of the accompanying software license (MIT or AGPL-3.0-or-later, at your choice). Instead, it is a statement of values that defines what it means to be part of the Cerro Torre community.

We adopt this covenant because we believe:

1. **Provenance matters.** Knowing where software came from, who changed it, and why, is essential for trust.

2. **Consent is foundational.** Software should respect user autonomy. Surveillance without informed consent is a violation of that autonomy.

3. **Transparency enables accountability.** When modifications are documented and visible, communities can hold maintainers accountable and learn from history.

4. **Technology serves people.** Software is not neutral. The choices we make as developers shape what is possible for users. We have responsibilities that accompany that power.

## The Covenant

As a member of the Cerro Torre community, I commit to:

### 1. Maintain Provenance

I will document the origin of contributions I make and preserve attribution to those who came before. When I modify software, I will record what I changed, when, and why, so that future maintainers can understand the evolution of the code.

I will not strip attribution, obscure origins, or claim sole credit for collaborative work.

### 2. Respect Consent

I will not use Cerro Torre software, or contribute to its use, in systems that surveil individuals without their informed consent.

I will design software that gives users meaningful choices about their data and agency over their digital lives.

I will not weaponise software against the people it purports to serve.

### 3. Practice Transparency

I will conduct project business in public where possible. Decisions that affect the community will be documented and explained.

I will not introduce hidden functionality, undisclosed telemetry, or covert channels.

When I make mistakes, I will acknowledge them openly and work to correct them.

### 4. Refuse Complicity in Harm

I will not contribute to uses of Cerro Torre that I know will cause serious, demonstrable harm to individuals or communities.

This includes, but is not limited to:
- Weapons systems designed to cause civilian casualties
- Tools for political repression or persecution of minorities
- Systems designed to deceive users about their nature or purpose
- Infrastructure for mass surveillance without judicial oversight

I recognise that "harm" is contested and context-dependent. When uncertain, I will seek guidance from the community and err on the side of caution.

### 5. Welcome Participation

I will treat all contributors with respect and dignity. I will judge contributions on their merit, not on the identity of the contributor.

I will work to make the project accessible to newcomers and will mentor those who seek to learn.

I will not tolerate harassment, discrimination, or abuse within project spaces.

## Interpretation

This covenant is aspirational. It describes the community we want to build, not a set of rules to be lawyered around.

When questions arise about whether conduct aligns with the covenant, the following principles apply:

1. **Good faith matters.** Honest mistakes and good-faith disagreements are not violations. The covenant is about intentions and patterns, not isolated incidents.

2. **Context matters.** Security research, journalism, human rights work, and other legitimate activities may involve edge cases. We extend trust to those doing difficult work for good reasons.

3. **Dialogue first.** Before escalating concerns, engage directly with the person involved. Most issues resolve through conversation.

4. **Community decides.** For persistent or serious concerns, the cooperative's governance processes determine outcomes. No individual has unilateral authority to interpret the covenant.

## Adoption

Adoption of the Palimpsest Covenant is voluntary. You may use Cerro Torre software without adopting it — the software licenses permit this.

However, to become a **member** of the Cerro Torre cooperative (with voting rights and maintainer status), you must affirm the covenant. This is not about gatekeeping; it is about ensuring that those who govern the project share its values.

If you choose to adopt the covenant, you may indicate this in your contributions with:

```
SPDX-License-Identifier: MPL-2.0-or-later
Palimpsest-Covenant: 1.0
```

## History

The Palimpsest Covenant evolved from the Palimpsest License v0.8, created by Joshua & Jonathan Jewell in 2024 as part of the MAA Framework. It was adapted into a covenant (rather than a license) for Cerro Torre to maintain legal clarity while preserving the values it articulated.

The original Palimpsest License remains available for projects that prefer an integrated license+values approach.

## Amendments

This covenant may be amended by the Cerro Torre cooperative through its standard governance process. Any amendments require a supermajority of maintainer members and must preserve the core commitments to provenance, consent, transparency, and harm refusal.

*We write on the palimpsest of all who came before us. May those who come after find our contributions worthy of preservation.*
