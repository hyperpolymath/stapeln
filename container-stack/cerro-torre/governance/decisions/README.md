## Process

During the pre-formation phase, the founder documents decisions for transparency. After cooperative formation, significant decisions require:

1. Proposal submitted as draft decision record
2. Two-week discussion period
3. Technical Council vote (technical decisions) or Board vote (governance decisions)
4. Record updated with outcome
