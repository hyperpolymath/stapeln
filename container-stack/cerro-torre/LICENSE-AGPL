SUMMARY (not a substitute for the full license):

The AGPL-3.0 grants you the freedom to:
- Use the software for any purpose
- Study how it works and modify it
- Distribute copies
- Distribute modified versions

With the conditions that:
- You must provide source code when distributing
- You must license derivatives under AGPL-3.0
- You must provide source code to users interacting over a network
- You must preserve copyright notices

The network provision (Section 13) is the key difference from GPL-3.0:
if you run a modified version on a server and users interact with it
remotely, you must offer them the source code.
