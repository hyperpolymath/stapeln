= ATS Shadow Verification Policy
:status: normative
:audience: maintainers, CI authors

== Purpose

ATS may be used as a *shadow verification tool* to reinforce confidence in the canonical implementation.

ATS is not part of the trusted computing base.

== Authority

* ATS output is advisory only.
* ATS MUST NOT declare artifacts valid or invalid.
* ATS MUST NOT generate canonical outputs.
* ATS MUST NOT be required at runtime.

== Allowed Uses

ATS MAY be used to:

* Check canonicalization idempotence
* Validate semantic equivalence over a declared subset
* Cross-check canonical bytes against spec rules
* Detect inconsistencies between spec and implementation

== Prohibited Uses

ATS MUST NOT:

* Override SPARK behavior
* Block production builds
* Act as a trust root
* Be referenced as authoritative in governance or legal contexts

== Failure Handling

If ATS disagrees with the SPARK core:

* CI MAY fail
* Human review is REQUIRED
* The SPARK output remains authoritative

== Survivability Requirement

The system MUST function correctly if ATS tooling is removed entirely.
