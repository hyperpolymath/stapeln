= Phase-0 MUST Alignment Record
:status: record
:audience: maintainers, reviewers

== Purpose

This document records decisions taken to satisfy Phase-0 MUST requirements.

== Answers Summary

* Canonical authority: written spec + single implementation
* Audit audience: auditors, lawyers, distro maintainers, future maintainers
* Failure tolerance: system must continue unchanged without advanced proof tooling
* Semantic authority: spec + goldens
* ATS role: advisory only
* Disagreement handling: human review
* Runtime dependency on ATS: none
* Governance visibility of ATS: optional tooling only
* Contributor scarcity tolerance: moderate
* Survivability requirement: mandatory

== Architectural Outcome

* Ada/SPARK is the canonical core
* ATS is a non-authoritative satellite
* Written spec and golden corpora define meaning
* Tooling reinforces but does not define trust

== Stability Statement

This record may be superseded only by an explicit governance decision.
