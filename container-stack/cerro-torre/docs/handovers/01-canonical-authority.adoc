= Canonical Authority and Language Policy
:status: normative
:audience: maintainers, auditors, foundations

== Decision Summary

The Cerro Torre project defines correctness and trust using:

* A written, normative specification
* A single authoritative implementation in Ada/SPARK
* Executable golden test corpora

Advanced proof tooling (including ATS) is permitted only as *non-authoritative reinforcement*.

== Canonical Source of Truth

The following are authoritative, in descending order:

1. The written specification (under /spec)
2. Golden test corpora (valid + invalid cases)
3. The Ada/SPARK reference implementation

No other artifact may define or override semantics.

== Language Policy

* Ada/SPARK is the sole canonical implementation language.
* The project MUST remain correct and buildable without any auxiliary proof tools.
* No semantic rule may exist only in implementation-level proofs or types.

== Rationale

This policy prioritizes:

* Auditability
* Institutional trust
* Long-term survivability
* Clear governance boundaries

Cleverness must not become a dependency.

== Non-Goals

This project does NOT attempt to:

* Encode full semantics in a type system
* Require dependent types for correctness
* Use multiple authoritative implementations
