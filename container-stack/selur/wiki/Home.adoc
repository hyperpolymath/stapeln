Welcome to the selur wiki! This documentation covers everything you need to know about using and developing with selur.

== What is selur?

selur is an Ephapax-linear WASM sealant that provides zero-copy IPC between Svalinn (edge gateway) and Vörðr (container orchestrator). It combines:

* **Ephapax-linear types** - Compile-time memory safety guarantees
* **WASM linear memory** - Zero-copy shared memory between host and guest
* **Idris2 formal proofs** - Mathematical correctness guarantees

**Performance:** 7-20x faster than JSON/HTTP (zero-copy vs 4 copies)

**Security:** Triple guarantee - compile-time linear types, runtime bounds checking, formal verification
