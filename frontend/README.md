# stapeln Frontend

This is the **stapeln UI application** (not the DOM‑mounter library).

## What This Is

- The visual, end‑user app for designing secure container stacks.
- Implemented with ReScript (TEA) and served with Deno.

## Quick Start

```bash
cd /var/mnt/eclipse/repos/stapeln/frontend
rescript build
deno task dev
```

## Notes

- The DOM‑mounter workstream has been extracted to `/var/mnt/eclipse/repos/stapeln-dom-mounter`.
